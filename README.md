# Advent of Code 2023!

It's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) time! I've only tinkered with a few of these puzzles each year, but as
I'm on sabbatical and am looking to get back into daily programming shape in time for the new year, I thought it would
be a great opportunity to work on these each day. Of course, life gets in the way sometimes, and I'm starting a couple
of days late (I write this as of December 3, 2023), but I'm looking forward to making this part of my daily routine 
for the next couple of weeks.

These exercises are all solved using PHP 8.2.

## Requirements
- PHP 8.2 or greater
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org)

## Dependencies
- Symfony Console (to enable running each of the exercises using a simple, standard command)

## Installation and Usage
1. Clone down this repo with `git clone https://github.com/jmichaelward/adventofcode2023`
2. Run `composer install`
3. Run `./aoc day {number}` where the number value is the puzzle where you want the solution output.
